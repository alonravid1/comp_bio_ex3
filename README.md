# Ex3 - Neural Network Pattern Learning
<b>by Alon Ravid and Sigal Grabois.<b> <br>
This project implements a genetic algorithm-based approach to identify patterns in binary strings using neural networks. The goal is to build neural networks that can accurately predict the legality of binary strings based on patterns learned from training data.<br>
